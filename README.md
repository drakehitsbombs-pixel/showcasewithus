Exploring how AI and engineering design principles intersect to create faster, smarter app development workflows.

# ShowCase — AI-Enhanced App Creation Platform

## 🚀 Overview

**ShowCase** is a web application originally built with **Lovable**, then expanded into a cross-platform app using modern web technologies.  
The goal of this project is to streamline how creatives and clients connect, while exploring how **AI-assisted development** can accelerate real product creation.

This project demonstrates how I’m combining my **Electrical Engineering background** with **software design and AI tools** to:

- Rapidly prototype and deploy production-ready web apps.
- Automate repetitive UI, deployment, and configuration tasks using AI generation workflows.
- Integrate human design insight with AI-generated components for faster iteration and more consistent code.

ShowCase serves as both a **portfolio project** and a **proof of concept** for leveraging AI to reduce the barrier to app development.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- **AI-Assisted Development:** Build, iterate, and deploy complete web experiences using natural-language prompts in Lovable and refine them in code.
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** Prepare the web app for use as a **PWA** and wrap it in **Capacitor** to publish to iOS and Android.
- **Design Consistency:** Use component libraries (shadcn-ui, TailwindCSS) and AI-generated assets to maintain a polished, responsive UI across devices.
- **Automation:** Sync all updates through GitHub for continuous deployment and version control.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Vite + React + TypeScript
- **UI Components:** shadcn-ui
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment / Hosting:** Lovable + GitHub
- **Native Wrapper (planned):** Capacitor for iOS / Android
- **AI Integration:** Lovable’s AI builder for scaffolding pages, UI, and logic

## 💡 How to Edit and Run Locally

You can modify the project either directly in Lovable or locally using your IDE.

### Option 1 — Edit in Lovable

Visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/ba19f4f0-46f2-4ef2-be61-5809ed262a98).  
All changes made there automatically sync with this repository.

### Option 2 — Edit Locally

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 3 — GitHub Codespaces

- Open your repo on GitHub.
- Click **Code → Codespaces → New Codespace**.
- Edit files directly in your browser IDE.
